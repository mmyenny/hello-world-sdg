  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p>My name is Michelle and I am 27 years old. I am originally from New Jersey and relocated to Florida about 4 years
    ago. I have an associates degree in business administration, but have recently decided to go back to school at
    Suncoast Developers Guild. I have a 7 year old daughter named Whitney and family is very important to me.</p>

  <p>Some hobbies of mine include creating art and reading. When I have free time I enjoy drawing, painting and working
    on kid friendly crafts with my daughter. I am highly interested in learning how to make a geode inspired painting.</p>
